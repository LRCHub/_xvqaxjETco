This is the lyrics for VIP ...

You wanna get with this because we've got it going on
You wanna get with us because we've got it going on
You wanna get with this because we've got it going on
You wanna get with us because we've got it going on

Check it out
I'm rolling
Steady strolling
The microphone is on
Yo let me hold it
Coming to the spot
Get it hot
Time to turn it up
So I can rock
The beats the rhymes
They're all at place
We wanna show you what we gonna do in the place
Hold it down, hold it down at the ground
Jungle Brothers bringing you that funky sound
All stiles no matter what you like
We bring it to you
Every day we're at the mic
Strike back find out where we at
Coming to you live

Yo!
We in the VIP

... and so on ...
